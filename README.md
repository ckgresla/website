# A Curated Tonkatsu

I don't like hugo, and although ruby is painful to build we are jekyll-ing now

\*see the `justfile` for some of the methods; things like running the jekyll server or linting the blog posts with [Vale](https://vale.sh/docs)

## Install

### Install Jekyll

Make sure you have Ruby & Jekyll installed - For a step-by-step guide, read Jekyll docs [installation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

### Install Theme

Extract the theme .zip file to your local computer. Navigate to the project root (it contains the README.md)

Run `bundle install` to install gems.

Then run `jekyll serve` or `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the Jekyll server.

To build the Jekyll site run `bundle exec jekyll build`

## Deploy

### Netlify

This theme is pre-configured to deploy with [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/).

> 💡 If you experience bundle install issues during the Netlify deployment, deleting the Gemfile.lock can sometimes help

### GitHub Pages

This theme works with GitHub Pages. If you are creating a GitHub Pages "Project site" then your site will be in a sub-folder i.e `http://username.github.io/repository` You will need to update the `baseurl` in the `_config.yml` for the asset paths to work correctly.

```yaml
# _config.yml
baseurl: "/jekyll-curate-pro" # This should be the name of your repo
```
