## Code Block

The best font is [JetBrains Mono NL](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/), look at it (NOW IN COLOR)!

```python
import this
# read the output of this module's import to become a Pythonista

for i in range(0, len(wiz)):
    print(f"Wizard #{i}")

num = 0
```

b = [0, 1, 2]
c = (
  "wow",
  "man"
)
```

**Definition**
: of something?

[primary](#){: .btn .btn--primary}

E = mc<sup>2</sup>

<strong>Yo this is sick</strong>
