title: "What Love is"
---


You are sitting alone in a cafe, there are ample people around and a fair bit of ambient noise. 

The steam from the espresso machine whistles, the wind slides out of the way for a passing car, a piano accompanied by a restful base hum on speakers playing some nameless jazz playlist, there are a few conversations that tend toward smiles just beyond earshot, the clink of a porcelain glass, your sigh.

You turn your head briefly, rather subconsciously, then return to whatever book, piece of code, or nonsensical thing that you were attending to. The noise stops.

You look back again...
