I was not really around for the late 90s or early 2000s internet, but it [sounds like a cool place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iOVatAR-bU) and to contribute to making today's internet a _cooler_ place here is a personally curated list of tools.

- [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) -- is a cross-platform, GPU accelerated terminal emulator. It can be configured beyond your heart's desire (one example of this extensibility being the removal of window decorations on MacOS, very sleek) + it is extremely snappy, which matters if you like to be _Blazingly_ fast
- [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) -- is at it's simplest, a lovely pastel theme. I reckon that it goes beyond being a simple palette of colors, becoming [an tasteful approach to productivity]().
- [Goyo (고요)](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim) -- 'distraction-free' writing in Vim, a nice way to get colored spellcheck, line wrapping and a focused writing experience in the Terminal. "Goyo" is Korean and roughly [translates](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%EA%B3%A0%EC%9A%94%ED%95%98%EB%8B%A4) to "to do"
- [Things3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) -- yes it exists only for the Apple Ecosystem, but it has a nearly perfect handle on the abstraction of Task Management (and isn't having the right abstraction kind of everything?)
- [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) -- My main machine is a MacBook, and I got into using magnet several years ago. I continue to use Magnet because I really enjoy the bindings and have not gone down the [BSP rabbit hole](https://www.reddit.com/r/bspwm/comments/f7vi62/what_is_binary_space_partitioning_doing_for_bspwm/) just yet. Some other window managers for MacOS I think are interesting are [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) and [Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle) -- on Linux the one I have used stably is [OpenBox](http://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page).
- [HHKB2](https://hhkeyboard.us/hhkb/pro-hybrid) -- absolutely [awesome](https://tonkatsu.io/napkins/thelastkeyboard/) and sounds [lovely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8rwpIMOdSk)
