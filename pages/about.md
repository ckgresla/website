Whats up!

My name is Chris, and I do a bit of ML engineering and research at [Wafer Systems](https://wafer.systems/). Currently, I am primarily focused on developing multimodal action models in order to create a "self-driving phone". I was born and raised in the city of Chicago and currently live in San Francisco.

As one should not think twice about an opportunity, one shouldn't hesitate to write down a good quote when you find it -- here is one I had the pleasure of coming about recently:

> “Style’s the hardest thing to get, and it’s not something you really strive for. I’m sure that Miles never really strived to be a stylist. He just strived to be himself, to learn, to develop, and to express a strong, independent personality. And at the end of it, it had an identity and that’s why he’s a stylist. But somebody might say, ’Wow, I could be a stylist by just reaching out and being strange.’ or reaching out and being different, or novel, and of course that’s a mistake.”
