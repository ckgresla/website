Professionally, I am a member of the technical staff @ [lindy.ai](https://lindy.ai) -- where I spend my days training language models to take meaningful actions in the real-world, on behalf of Users.

My primary research interests lay in natural language processing for action execution, classic reinforcement learning, novel deep learning architectures and things that look like intelligence.

I am a Chicago Native and currently call San Francisco Home.

I like to keep an archive of quotes, here is a recent one of note:
