Im a kid from Chicago that loves; the cultures of this world, good food, jazz, awesome people and messing with neural networks.

Professionally, I am a member of the technical staff @ [lindy.ai](https://lindy.ai) -- where I spend my days helping language models learn to work.

My primary research interests lay in nlp for action execution, classic reinforcement learning, novel trainable architectures and generally anything that looks like ai, space or nuclear fusion.

If you also happen to be a cool person, say hi- ckgresla at gmail.com

## Tools I Love

Although I wasn't really around for the late 90s or early 2000s internet, it [sounds like a cool place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iOVatAR-bU) and to contribute to making today's internet a _cooler_ place here is a curated list of tools that bring me joy.

- [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) -- is a cross-platform, GPU accelerated terminal emulator. It can be configured beyond your heart's desire (one example of this extensibility being the removal of window decorations on MacOS, very sleek) + it is extremely snappy, which matters if you like to be _Blazingly_ fast
- [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) -- is at it's simplest, a lovely pastel theme. I reckon that it goes beyond being a simple palette of colors, becoming [an tasteful approach to productivity]().
- [Goyo (고요)](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim) -- 'distraction-free' writing in Vim, a nice way to get colored spellcheck, line wrapping and a focused writing experience in the Terminal. "Goyo" is Korean and roughly [translates](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%EA%B3%A0%EC%9A%94%ED%95%98%EB%8B%A4) to "to do"
- [Things3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) -- yes it exists only for the Apple Ecosystem, but it has a nearly perfect handle on the abstraction of Task Management (and isn't having the right abstraction kind of everything?)
- [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) -- My main machine is a MacBook, and I got into using magnet several years ago. I continue to use Magnet because I really enjoy the bindings and have not gone down the [BSP rabbit hole](https://www.reddit.com/r/bspwm/comments/f7vi62/what_is_binary_space_partitioning_doing_for_bspwm/) just yet. Some other window managers for MacOS I think are interesting are [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) and [Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle) -- on Linux the one I have used stably is [OpenBox](http://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page).
- [HHKB2](https://hhkeyboard.us/hhkb/pro-hybrid) -- absolutely [awesome](https://tonkatsu.io/napkins/thelastkeyboard/) and sounds [lovely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8rwpIMOdSk)

I like to keep an archive of quotes, here is a recent one of note:
